## Torzon darknet market FAQ:

Here we answer 10 of the most commonly asked questions from users of Torzon market:

** 1. Which cryptocurrencies are accepted on Torzon?
Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR), However we recommend XMR as BTC fees are much higher and not as stable.

1 confirmation for Bitcoin and 10 confirmations for Monero. However if you use walletless pay (pay at the checkout), you don't need to wait!

** 3. Are wallet addresses Torzon dynamic?
Yes. Please do not deposit into the same one twice. If you do, you will need to create a support ticket on Torzon onion then we can credit your account manually.

4% (which makes us lower than many competitor markets).

** 7. How does the dispute system work?
We recommend contacting the vendor raising a dispute, but you can escalate any open order as a dispute. A shared communication will be opened to allow dialogue between both the buyer and vendor which will be overseen by a moderator. In the event a resolution cannot be agreed upon, the moderator will make the final decision.

** 8. Can vendors buy products on Torzon?
Not using their vendor account. This is for the security of the vendor. Just create a separate customer account.

** 9. What is vacation mode?
This means a vendor is away and not trading at the moment, therefore not accepting any new orders.

Open a dispute or report the vendor, we will take care of it.
